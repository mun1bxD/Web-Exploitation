**Identifying API endpoints**

You can also gather a lot of information by browsing applications that use the API. This is often worth doing even if you have access to API documentation, as sometimes documentation may be inaccurate or out of date.

You can use Burp Scanner to crawl the application, then manually investigate interesting attack surface using Burp's browser.

While browsing the application, look for patterns that suggest API endpoints in the URL structure, such as /api/. Also look out for JavaScript files. These can contain references to API endpoints that you haven't triggered directly via the web browser. Burp Scanner automatically extracts some endpoints during crawls, but for a more heavyweight extraction, use the JS Link Finder BApp. You can also manually review JavaScript files in Burp.

**Interacting with API endpoints**

Once you've identified API endpoints, interact with them using Burp Repeater and Burp Intruder. This enables you to observe the API's behavior and discover additional attack surface. For example, you could investigate how the API responds to changing the HTTP method and media type.

As you interact with the API endpoints, review error messages and other responses closely. Sometimes these include information that you can use to construct a valid HTTP request.

**Identifying supported HTTP methods**

The HTTP method specifies the action to be performed on a resource. For example:

- GET - Retrieves data from a resource.
- PATCH - Applies partial changes to a resource.
- OPTIONS - Retrieves information on the types of request methods that can be used on a resource.

An API endpoint may support different HTTP methods. It's therefore important to test all potential methods when you're investigating API endpoints. This may enable you to identify additional endpoint functionality, opening up more attack surface.

For example, the endpoint /api/tasks may support the following methods:

- GET /api/tasks - Retrieves a list of tasks.
- POST /api/tasks - Creates a new task.
- DELETE /api/tasks/1 - Deletes a task.

You can use the built-in HTTP verbs list in Burp Intruder to automatically cycle through a range of methods.

**Note**

When testing different HTTP methods, target low-priority objects. This helps make sure that you avoid unintended consequences, for example altering critical items or creating excessive records.

**Identifying supported content types**

API endpoints often expect data in a specific format. They may therefore behave differently depending on the content type of the data provided in a request. Changing the content type may enable you to:

- Trigger errors that disclose useful information.
- Bypass flawed defenses.
- Take advantage of differences in processing logic. For example, an API may be secure when handling JSON data but susceptible to injection attacks when dealing with XML.

To change the content type, modify the Content-Type header, then reformat the request body accordingly. You can use the Content type converter BApp to automatically convert data submitted within requests between XML and JSON.

**LAB**

To solve the lab, exploit a hidden API endpoint to buy a Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.
**Step 1:**
Login to account using username wiener and password peter

**Step 2**
Now go to home and click on product

<img src="../images/Screenshot15.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 3**
Capture the response in burpsuite. We see get method is use to get the price of product having id 1.

<img src="../images/Screenshot16.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 4**  
Send it to repeater. In repeater the response show that it extract price of jacket

<img src="../images/Screenshot17.png" alt="third" width="500">

As we see clearly that the response shows that it support content-type application/json.
<img src="../images/Screenshot18.png" alt="third" width="500">

The response is still ok.

**Step 5**
Now we change http method and check supported method we use POST method
<img src="../images/Screenshot19.png" alt="third" width="500">
  
The output shows that that it support only get and patch method.
<img src="../images/Screenshot20.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 6**
1.Change http method to PATCH
2.add bracket {} and see the output

<img src="../images/Screenshot21.png" alt="third" width="500">

The output show that price parameter is missing so we add price parameter and initialize it to zero. With this, result in the price of jacket will be zero.

<img src="../images/Screenshot22.png" alt="third" width="500">

**Step 7**
Add price parameter
<img src="../images/Screenshot23.png" alt="third" width="500">

<img src="../images/Screenshot24.png" alt="third" width="500">

Now we simply go and add the jacket to cart.
<img src="../images/Screenshot25.png" alt="third" width="500">

simply click on place order to it.

**Using Intruder to find hidden endpoints**
Once you have identified some initial API endpoints, you can use Intruder to uncover hidden endpoints. For example, consider a scenario where you have identified the following API endpoint for updating user information:

PUT /api/user/update

To identify hidden endpoints, you could use Burp Intruder to find other resources with the same structure. For example, you could add a payload to the /update position of the path with a list of other common functions, such as delete and add.

When looking for hidden endpoints, use wordlists based on common API naming conventions and industry terms. Make sure you also include terms that are relevant to the application, based on your initial recon.
